# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was originally assigned to be made as a two player game where the two-dimensional arrays could simulate a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. However, I took it a step further by making a computer algorithm which performed two important tasks:
1. Read the user's move and determine when two adjacent spaces were filled, and place an appropriate block to prevent the user from winning.
2. Read the computer's own board to determine if a win was possible.

This program was simply a beginner project, and as a result I have no desire to further update it until I understand more Java to make a better algorithm and add better graphics than a two-dimensional array.
